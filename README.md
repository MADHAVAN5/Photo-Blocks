# PHOTO BLOCKS
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. The **DApp** for photographers **built** on a **Algorand Network** to **authenticate** ownership for the work of photographers. Also photographers can **showcase** their photographies to consumers for **hiring them for an event** and also helps the photographers to mint their **photographies to NFT** and our platform acts as a marketplace for that NFT's.
